# Minimal Calculator

A calm, minimalist calculator web app with built-in tip splitting and change calculation.
Designed to be fast, distraction-free, and usable in real-life scenarios (restaurants, bars, group payments).

## Features
- Basic calculator (clean, responsive)
- Tip calculator with:
  - People split (1–10)
  - Tip percentage
  - Per-person total (with tip)
- Change calculator:
  - Product price
  - Paid amount
  - Split payment in EUR/BGN
  - Automatic change / remaining amount
- Fixed EUR ⇄ BGN conversion (1 EUR = 1.95583 BGN)
- Dark, minimal UI
- Fully responsive (desktop & mobile)
- Installable PWA (offline-first)
- Preferences persisted locally

## Why
Most calculator apps are cluttered or slow.
This project explores how far a **minimal UI** can go while still solving real, everyday problems.

## Tech
- Vanilla HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- Service Worker (offline-first)
- Web App Manifest (PWA)
- No frameworks, no backend
