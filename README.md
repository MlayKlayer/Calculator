# Minimal Calculator

A calm, minimalist utility calculator built for real-life payments — **tip splitting** and **change calculation** — with a clean, fast UI that works great on both desktop and mobile.

Designed for restaurants, bars, quick group payments, and everyday “how much do we each owe?” moments.

## Why

Most calculator apps are cluttered, slow, or try to do everything.
This project explores how far a minimalist UI can go while still solving **everyday money problems** quickly and reliably.
